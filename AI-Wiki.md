|Scki-kit Learn| Sci-kit learn is a very powerful Python library for machine learning that is majorly used in building models. Built using other libraries such as numpy, SciPy, and matplotlib, it is very efficient for statistical modeling techniques such as classification, regression, and clustering. Sci-kit learn comes with features such as supervised learning algorithms, unsupervised learning algorithms, and cross-validation.|[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  [Linear Regression Using Python scikit-learn](https://dzone.com/articles/linear-regression-using-python-scikit-learn)|
